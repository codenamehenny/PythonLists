# Task 1: Given the list of grades, Sort the grades in descending order and print the sorted list.

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]
grades.sort() # sorts list in order
print(grades)

#Task 2: Calculate the average grade and print it.
avg = sum(grades) / len(grades) # calculates the sum of the list and divde that by the number of integers in the list.
print(avg)
